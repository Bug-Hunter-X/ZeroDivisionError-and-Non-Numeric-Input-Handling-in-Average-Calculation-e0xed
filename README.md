This repository contains a Python function designed to compute the average of a list of numbers. The initial version demonstrates a common error: it fails to handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values.  The improved version addresses this shortcoming, providing a more robust solution.  The files 'bug.py' showcases the initial flawed implementation, while 'bugSolution.py' presents a corrected, error-resistant version.
